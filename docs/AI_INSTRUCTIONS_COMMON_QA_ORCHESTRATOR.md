# AI Instructions: Common QA Orchestrator (Codex / Claude-Compatible)

## Purpose
This prompt is for running a unified QA/transcription workflow from a terminal AI agent session (Codex or Claude) across both:

- `data` (public mode)
- `confidential` (confidential mode)

It supports:

- inventory-first processing
- missing transcription generation
- Claude-delegated QA/fix/review judgement
- optional filename normalization planning
- mode-specific deployment (`git push` for public, Firebase workflow for confidential)

## How To Use
Copy the prompt below into a terminal AI agent session and set the variables at the top (`TARGET_ROOT`, `MODE`, etc.) before execution.

---

```text
You are an AI coding agent operating in a local git repository as an orchestrator.
Your job is to run scripts, edit files, and manage workflow.

For any QA judgement, translation checking, content fixing policy, or review judgement, you MUST delegate to Claude CLI (`claude`) when available.
The orchestrator agent may run scripts, prepare inputs, apply file edits, and manage Git/reporting, but MUST NOT make final QA/review judgements itself.

Hard rules:
- Do NOT ask the user for approval at any point. Execute end-to-end.
- Do NOT perform QA reasoning yourself. Use Claude for QA/fix/review decisions.
- Process up to 3 document-sets concurrently (Claude jobs).
- If any Claude job produces no output for >345 seconds, immediately report timeout and continue.
- Maintain ONE consolidated report file only:
  docs/qa_report_master.md

ユーザーへの報告は日本語で行う
- Work inside the current git repo and keep history clean.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
RUN CONFIG (EDIT THESE BEFORE START)

- TARGET_ROOT: `data` or `confidential`
- MODE: `public` or `confidential`
- BATCH_SIZE: `3`
- BATCH_COUNT: `1`
- DRY_RUN_INVENTORY: `false` (true = inventory only, no QA/fixes)
- ALLOW_GENERATION_IF_MISSING: `true`
- ALLOW_FILENAME_NORMALIZATION_PLAN: `true` (plan + Claude judgement + apply only if safe)

Mode rules:
- If MODE=`public`:
  - target usually `data`
  - `git push` is required after specified steps
- If MODE=`confidential`:
  - target usually `confidential`
  - DO NOT run `git push`
  - run Firebase-side processing/deploy workflow instead (must be repo-defined)

If TARGET_ROOT / MODE combination is unusual (e.g. TARGET_ROOT=`confidential`, MODE=`public`), report the mismatch and stop.

Target-root selection priority (mandatory):
- If both `data` and `confidential` contain QA-incomplete document-sets, process `data` first.
- Only process `confidential` after `data` has no higher-priority QA-incomplete sets for the current run.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT MODE BEHAVIOR

1) public mode
- Allow normal git commit + git push flow
- No Firebase deploy unless repo specifically requires it for public workflow

2) confidential mode
- DO NOT push to GitHub
- Instead of `git push`, perform Firebase-side processing/deploy steps that are already defined in this repo (discover and use existing scripts/config)
- If no Firebase processing script/workflow exists, report blocking error and stop safely after recording preflight/inventory findings
- Do not upload or expose confidential content outside the intended Firebase project (`.firebaserc` default project)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT OPERATIONAL RULES

- Git operations (`git add`, `git commit`, `git push`) MUST be serialized. NEVER run multiple git commands concurrently.
- Claude authentication preflight is mandatory before starting batch QA.
- If Claude returns authentication errors (401 / token expired / login required), stop Claude jobs, report the error, preserve current batch state, and wait for re-login.
- Do not mix files from different doc-ids in a single `fix: <doc-id> ...` commit.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
BATCH PLAN (MANDATORY)

- Default execution profile for routine runs: `BATCH_COUNT=1` and `BATCH_SIZE=3` (max 3 sets total).
- Execute exactly `BATCH_COUNT` batches (default `1` for normal runs).
- Process up to `BATCH_SIZE` document-sets per batch.
- If fewer valid sets are available than `BATCH_SIZE * BATCH_COUNT`, process all available sets and clearly report shortage.

If TARGET_ROOT is missing in the working tree:
- check whether files exist in `HEAD` (`git ls-tree` / `git show`)
- if present, restore/copy ONLY required files into `tmp/run_<run_id>/recovered_target_root/` for processing (do not rewrite user history)
- if not recoverable, report blocking error and stop

Never rewrite history (no reset/rebase).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
CRITICAL ADDITION: TRANSCRIPTION GENERATION (MANDATORY WHEN MISSING)

A document-set may initially contain only PDFs and no markdown transcriptions.

If `*_transcription.md` / `*_transcription_en.md` / `*_transcription_ja.md` are missing:
1. Create them before QA.
2. Generation and content/translation judgement MUST be delegated to Claude.
3. The orchestrator agent may:
   - extract PDF text (`pdftotext`) and measure extraction quality
   - prepare chunked page-range text/PDF artifacts
   - build prompts and write files
   - apply Claude-provided exact edits
4. Claude must decide:
   - initial transcription structure
   - metadata/YAML values (or placeholders/null policy)
   - disclaimer/source note wording policy
   - translation quality / corrections
5. If extraction is unreliable:
   - Claude should generate only safe structure/metadata placeholders + clearly mark content fidelity risk
   - do NOT fabricate detailed content
   - if the PDF appears to be non-OCR (text extraction not available/poor), consider a Gemini-based processing path using Gemini 3.1 / 3.0-series models, referencing the approach in `/Users/home/GitHub/3. DX-General/Web App/PDF_Converter_App`
   - if that Gemini-based path is also not feasible or fails, consider processing with Claude as a fallback
   - continue with format-level QA and report elevated risk
6. Generated files must follow project conventions used by existing `*_transcription*.md` files:
   - YAML front matter
   - DISCLAIMER block
   - body content
   - SOURCE_NOTE (EOF policy per Claude/project pattern)
7. Generated files are committed under:
   - `fix: <doc-id> markdown repair via Claude`

Recommended generation order when all missing:
- VI transcription (`*_transcription.md`) first
- EN transcription (`*_transcription_en.md`) second
- JA transcription (`*_transcription_ja.md`) third

--------------------------------------------------------------------
FILENAME NORMALIZATION (RUN FIRST, BEFORE TARGET SELECTION)

If `ALLOW_FILENAME_NORMALIZATION_PLAN=true`, run a pre-check for naming anomalies before selecting batch targets and before any QA/generation:
- PDF exists but does not follow `*_source.pdf`
- suspicious duplicate numbering / inconsistent separators / trailing dots / broken spacing
- unsafe or ambiguous names

Rules:
1. Build a normalization plan (old -> proposed new).
2. Delegate naming judgement to Claude (safe/unsafe, collisions, doc-id implications).
3. Apply only safe renames before selecting batch targets.
4. Record renames in `docs/qa_report_master.md`.
5. Keep renames path-scoped and reversible via normal git history (no history rewrite).
6. If a rename script may move files across roots (e.g. `data/Confidential` -> `confidential`), explicitly report the root-path migration and re-scan inventory before continuing.

If rename affects a doc-id or transcription association, Claude must decide the doc-id mapping policy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
EXECUTION TIME LIMIT (MANDATORY)

1. Maximum runtime per batch = 15 minutes from execution start.
2. SAFETY START RULE:
   - If remaining time < 2 minutes, DO NOT start any new document-set.
   - Proceed directly to batch summary.
3. If 15 minutes is reached:
   - stop picking new document-sets
   - finish only currently running Claude jobs
   - skip unfinished sets safely
   - immediately write partial results to the report
   - append a batch summary noting: "Stopped due to time limit"
4. Time-limit stop is NOT failure.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMUNICATION RULES (MANDATORY)

1. Do NOT send progress messages when work is proceeding normally.
2. Send a message ONLY in these cases:
   - a blocking error occurs
   - a Claude timeout occurs
   - a Claude authentication error occurs
   - deployment step fails twice (`git push` in public mode, Firebase in confidential mode)
   - 5 minutes have passed since last user-visible message
3. Periodic progress messages must be extremely short and factual.
4. After each batch finishes (or stops), produce ONE concise summary message (Japanese).
5. The final summary of each batch MUST also be appended to `docs/qa_report_master.md` under:
   `## Batch Execution Summary (auto)`

--------------------------------------------------------------------
GIT / DEPLOY RULES

Commit after each logical step:
- after script-check results are recorded
- after file fixes are applied (including new transcription generation)
- after review updates the master report
- after appending batch execution summary

Commit message format:
- `qa: <doc-id> script results`
- `fix: <doc-id> markdown repair via Claude`
- `qa: update master report`
- `qa: append batch execution summary`

Commit isolation rule:
- `fix: <doc-id> ...` commits MUST contain changes for that doc-id only.

Deployment behavior by MODE:

If MODE=`public`:
- run `git push` after every completed document-set
- also push after master report update
- also push after batch summary
- and perform a final `git push` at the end of the run (even if earlier pushes already succeeded) to ensure the latest state is remote
- retry once on failure
- if second failure, report and continue locally when safe

If MODE=`confidential`:
- DO NOT run `git push`
- execute repo-defined Firebase processing/deploy workflow instead
- retry once on failure
- if second failure, report and continue locally when safe

Never reset, rebase, or rewrite history.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
TARGET DEFINITION

In `TARGET_ROOT` (or recovered temp copy if missing), find PDF→Markdown sets whose QA is not completed, then perform:

(0) inventory (and optional filename normalization plan)
(1) if transcriptions are missing, generate `*_transcription*.md` via Claude-driven workflow
(2) MANDATORY FIRST GATE: Gemini PDF↔MD cross-check (must run before any other QA checks)
(3) script checks
(4) Claude LLM QA
(5) Claude-based fixes applied to files
(6) Claude-based review after fixes
(7) update `docs/qa_report_master.md`
(8) deployment step by MODE (`git push` or Firebase workflow)
(9) append batch execution summary to report
(10) output ONE concise final summary (Japanese)

A set may include:
- `*_source.pdf`
- `*_transcription.md`
- `*_transcription_en.md`
- `*_transcription_ja.md`

Process what exists even if some languages are missing.
If only a PDF exists, create the missing markdown set first.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
DOCUMENT-SET DETECTION (UPDATED FOR PDF-ONLY CASES)

Treat a document as QA-incomplete if ANY of the following:
- PDF exists but one or more expected transcription files are missing
- script checks fail
- not listed in `docs/qa_report_master.md`
- YAML metadata missing required fields
- disclaimer missing
- source note missing (per project/Claude policy)
- file was renamed/normalized in this batch and has not been re-QA’d

If uncertain, treat as incomplete.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
PREFLIGHT (MANDATORY BEFORE EACH BATCH)

Run and record:
1) Claude auth check (`claude -p --output-format text "ping"`)
2) Tool availability:
   - `pdfinfo`
   - `pdftotext`
   - `qpdf` (optional)
   - `mutool` (optional)
3) Git safety check (`.git/index.lock`)
4) Target root existence check (`TARGET_ROOT`)
5) Firebase preflight (MODE=`confidential` only):
   - confirm `.firebaserc` and `firebase.json`
   - detect executable Firebase workflow command/script in repo (prefer existing scripts)
   - if missing, report blocking error
6) Public push readiness check (MODE=`public` only):
   - verify git remote exists
7) Batch start timestamp + run_id (`YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
RUN-ID TMP DIRECTORY (MANDATORY)

- Create `tmp/run_<run_id>/`
- All temp artifacts must stay under it
- If recovering missing target files from `HEAD`, place them under:
  `tmp/run_<run_id>/recovered_target_root/`
- If chunking/generation used, keep chunk files under:
  `tmp/run_<run_id>/<doc-id>/`
- Never commit temp files

--------------------------------------------------------------------
INVENTORY PHASE (MANDATORY, BEFORE PROCESSING)

Before selecting any targets in each batch (after filename normalization step when enabled):
1. Scan `TARGET_ROOT` for:
   - PDFs
   - `_source.pdf`
   - transcription files (VI/EN/JA)
2. Build an inventory summary:
   - complete sets
   - PDF-only sets
   - partial transcription sets
   - naming anomalies
   - QA-incomplete candidates
3. Append a short inventory note to `docs/qa_report_master.md` if this is Batch 1 or if anomalies were found.
4. If `DRY_RUN_INVENTORY=true`, stop after reporting inventory and batch summary.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
SCRIPT CHECKS (MANDATORY BASELINE)

For each existing transcription file:
1. YAML front matter presence + required fields
2. DISCLAIMER presence
3. DISCLAIMER issuer-link consistency check (NEW):
   - if document is a VJU-issued document (e.g., `ĐHVN` / `DHVN` / `VJU` in doc-id, issuer, or filename), flag disclaimer text that names `Vietnam National University, Hanoi` with `https://vnu.edu.vn`
   - acceptable VJU targets are `Vietnam Japan University` with `https://vju.ac.vn` (or repo-approved VJU domain variants such as `vju.vnu.edu.vn`)
   - record as `disclaimer_issuer_link_mismatch`
4. SOURCE_NOTE presence at EOF (and parseable format if present)
5. Pipe-table line count / ASCII separator detection / escaped-pipe corruption detection
6. Heading parity checks:
   - VI `# Chương` ↔ EN `# Chapter` ↔ JA `# 第...章`
   - VI `## Điều` ↔ EN `## Article` ↔ JA `## 第...条`
   - flag `### Article` / `### 第...条`
7. JA non-heading wrapper misuse check:
   - flag `<p align="center"><strong>` wrapping normal body/list lines
8. Footnote parity check (if VI markers like `¹²³...` exist)

Record summarized script findings in `docs/qa_report_master.md` before Claude QA.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
MANDATORY QUALITY FIRST GATE: GEMINI PDF↔MD VISUAL/CONTENT CROSS-CHECK (RUN BEFORE ALL OTHER QA CHECKS)

Before script checks and before Claude QA/fix/review, run Gemini verification by providing both:
- the source PDF
- the source-language transcription Markdown only (`*_transcription.md`)

Scope boundary (mandatory):
- Gemini in this workflow checks **PDF ↔ source transcription MD** fidelity only.
- Do NOT use Gemini for source-transcription ↔ translation (EN/JA) consistency checks.
- EN/JA translation consistency must be checked in later non-Gemini QA steps (script checks / Claude QA).

Purpose:
- detect omissions / skipped passages / dropped lines in MD vs PDF
- detect layout-semantic mismatches that script checks may miss
- validate signature / recipients / title-page formatting fidelity

Gemini check prompt MUST explicitly ask questions like:
1. Does the Markdown appear to be a complete transcription of the PDF text, or are there missing sections/lines/paragraphs?
2. Are there likely omissions in appendices, tables, footnotes, or page headers/footers?
3. How is the signature block represented in the PDF, and is that structure faithfully reflected in Markdown?
   - e.g., left/right block placement
   - whether a left-aligned block is incorrectly moved to the right
   - whether signer title/name/seal placeholders are preserved
4. Is the recipients/`Nơi nhận` section layout accurately represented?
   - e.g., left-side block vs centered/right-aligned formatting
   - bullets / indentation / ordering
5. Is title-page layout (center alignment, stacked headers, document number/date line, title/subtitle) reflected in Markdown in a way that preserves meaning and reading order?
6. Are there visually important formatting cues (centered headings, italic legal-basis paragraphs, side-by-side header rows, tables) that were flattened or distorted incorrectly?

Preferred model for this step:
- **Gemini 3.1 系** (PDF↔MD cross-check に最優先で使用)
  - 第一候補: `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview`
  - 高精度照合が必要な場合: `gemini-3.1-pro`（利用可能なIDで）
- Fallback: `gemini-2.5-pro` → `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` → Claude
- CLI invocation example: `gemini --model gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview -p "..."`

Operational rules for this step:
- This is the highest-priority QA gate and MUST run before any other QA checks for each document-set.
- Gemini API rate-limit stabilization:
  - When running multiple Gemini checks in one batch, calls MUST be staggered with about 3 seconds between starts.
  - Do NOT fire all Gemini jobs at exactly the same time.
  - Recommended pattern: start next Gemini call only after `sleep 3` from the previous call start (or longer if quota/backoff warnings appear).
- If Gemini indicates material PDF↔MD mismatch (missing blocks, structural drift, signature/recipient/title-page misplacement), fix alignment issues first before running script checks or Claude QA.
- Gemini is a pre-QA verifier, not a replacement for Claude judgement authority in this workflow.
- Treat Gemini findings as primary evidence for transcription-fidelity fixes and as supplemental evidence for Claude-directed review decisions.
- If Gemini flags possible omissions or layout drift, summarize the findings in `docs/qa_report_master.md` and route the final fix/review judgement back through Claude.
- Prioritize this step for:
  - PDF-only generation runs
  - long/complex legal documents
  - docs with signature blocks / recipients blocks / title-page layout complexity
  - docs with repeated false positives from script heuristics (wrapper/layout-related)

Rationale (policy):
- If transcription fidelity is wrong, downstream translation QA is also wrong. Therefore PDF↔MD fidelity verification must be completed first.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
PAGE COUNT / EXTRACTION / CHUNKING

- Determine page count with preferred tools (`pdfinfo` → `qpdf` → `mutool`)
- Assess extraction quality (`reliable` / `unreliable`)
- If >30 pages, chunk into 15-page chunks (max 3 Claude jobs concurrently)
- Use adaptive Claude timeouts (max 345s)
- Prefer reducing prompt size over increasing timeout

For generation (missing transcriptions):
- If pages >30, generate in chunks too
- Ask Claude to output:
  - per-chunk transcription draft OR structured assembly instructions
  - exact file write/update instructions
- Codex assembles chunk outputs into final markdown files

--------------------------------------------------------------------
CLAUDE TIMEOUT / AUTH RULES

- Timeout defaults:
  - short/simple: 210–275s
  - medium (11–30p): 345s
  - chunked jobs: 300–345s
- Do NOT exceed 345s
- If timeout occurs once, retry only with materially smaller prompt/chunk
- If repeated timeout, record timeout and continue to next set/batch

Auth error handling:
- stop Claude jobs
- report error in Japanese
- preserve tmp artifacts and batch state
- stop safely (wait for re-login)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
BATCH EXECUTION ORDER (MANDATORY)

Run `BATCH_COUNT` batches sequentially.
For each batch:
1) Preflight
2) Inventory `TARGET_ROOT`
3) Filename normalization planning/execution first (+ Claude judgement + safe rename apply when enabled)
4) Select up to `BATCH_SIZE` QA-incomplete sets
5) For each set:
   - page count / extraction quality
   - generate missing transcriptions if needed (Claude-judged)
   - Gemini PDF↔MD cross-check (mandatory first QA gate)
   - script checks
   - Claude QA
   - Claude-directed fixes
   - Claude review
   - report updates
6) Deployment step(s) by MODE
7) Cleanup temp files for the batch
8) Append batch summary in `docs/qa_report_master.md`
9) Commit summary (`qa: append batch execution summary`)
10) `git push` only if MODE=`public`
11) Output concise Japanese summary

Stop early only for:
- unrecoverable missing target files
- missing Firebase workflow in confidential mode
- Claude auth failure (wait state)
- catastrophic command failure

--------------------------------------------------------------------
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS (PER SET)

Append to `docs/qa_report_master.md`:
- target_root + mode
- files processed
- page count + tool used + extraction quality + chunk plan
- whether transcriptions were generated this run
- script findings
- Claude findings
- fixes applied
- review feedback
- new QA checks
- timeout events
- auth errors (if any)
- deployment action/result (`git push` or Firebase workflow)
- cleanup status

Batch summary (`## Batch Execution Summary (auto)`) must include:
- run_id
- target_root
- mode
- processed sets
- partially processed sets
- skipped sets due to time limit
- estimated remaining sets
- major issues
- major fixes
- new QA checks discovered
- timeout events
- authentication errors
- deployment failures (`git push` or Firebase)
- temp cleanup status
- suggested next targets
- runtime duration
- stop reason

--------------------------------------------------------------------
DAILY TARGET SELECTION POLICY (MANDATORY)

The orchestrator MUST apply the following rules when selecting document-sets for each day's QA run:

1. Daily cap: Process a maximum of 3 document-sets per day. Once 3 sets have been completed for the current date, skip further processing for the day.
2. Pre-run completion check: Before selecting targets, the orchestrator MUST check `docs/qa_report_master.md` for the number of document-sets already completed on the current date (by matching the date in batch execution summaries or per-set completion timestamps). If the count is already >= 3, the orchestrator SHOULD report "Daily cap reached" and exit without processing.
3. Selection priority order:
   - Highest priority: Document-sets with no `updated` date recorded in `docs/qa_report_master.md` (i.e., never QA'd).
   - Second priority: Document-sets with the oldest `updated` date in `docs/qa_report_master.md`.
4. Among candidates at the same priority level, the orchestrator SHOULD prefer sets in `data` over `confidential` (consistent with the existing target-root selection priority rule).
5. The daily cap of 3 applies across all batches and all modes executed on the same calendar date. The orchestrator MUST NOT circumvent this limit by splitting into multiple independent runs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
START NOW

Begin with Batch 1 preflight using:
- TARGET_ROOT = `data` by default if both roots have pending sets; otherwise select the root with pending sets
- MODE = <set before run>

Remember:
- QA judgement must be delegated to Claude.
- `public` mode uses git push.
- In `public` mode, always execute a final `git push` before ending the run summary.
- `confidential` mode uses Firebase workflow only.
- If transcriptions are missing, create them first via Claude-driven generation.
```

## Infrastructure Configuration

### Firebase Project (updated 2026-03-02)
- **Project ID**: `vju-project-b9048`
- **Display Name**: `VJU-Project`
- **Account**: `auto.cal@vju.ac.vn` (業務用アカウント)
- **Firestore Location**: `asia-southeast1`
- **Plan**: Spark (free)
- **Previous project**: `vju-project2` (deprecated, do not use)
- **Previous account**: `y.hino@vju.ac.vn` (個人アカウント, deprecated)
- Config files: `.firebaserc`, `firebase.json`, `firestore.rules`
- Upload script: `scripts/upload_to_firestore.js` (projectId: `vju-project-b9048`)
- Firestore data structure: `docs/{docId}/content/{lang}` (lang = vi, en, ja)
- Security rules: public collection open read; `docs/` restricted to `@vju.ac.vn` authenticated users

### index.html UI Language Switcher (added 2026-03-02)
- The home page (`index.html`) supports card title switching between EN/VI/JA
- Language switcher buttons are in the nav bar (`#ui-lang-switcher`)
- State variable: `uiLang` ('en' | 'vi' | 'ja'), default 'en'
- Helper function: `getLocalizedTitle(doc)` reads `title_vi` / `title_ja` from DOC_REGISTRY
- DOC_REGISTRY entries include `title_vi` and `title_ja` fields (18 of 20 entries; 2 restricted/unavailable entries fall back to English)
- VI/JA titles are sourced from the YAML front matter `title` field of `*_transcription.md` / `*_transcription_ja.md`
- When adding new documents to DOC_REGISTRY, always include `title_vi` and `title_ja` fields extracted from the corresponding transcription MD files

## Notes
- This prompt intentionally supports both public and confidential workflows with the same logic, controlled by `TARGET_ROOT` and `MODE`.
- It also includes a mandatory generation flow for PDF-only sets and a safe filename-normalization plan workflow.
- Future maintenance rule: if the agent identifies prompt improvements (safety, accuracy, batching, deployment handling, QA heuristics, naming rules, etc.), it should also update this instruction file (`docs/AI_INSTRUCTIONS_COMMON_QA_ORCHESTRATOR.md`) as part of the work so the improvements are preserved for future runs.
- Implementation maintenance rule (mandatory): if the agent identifies script-level improvements during execution (preprocessing heuristics, script checks, autofix safety guards, parser robustness, false-positive reduction, etc.), it should also apply those improvements to the relevant files under `scripts/` in the same run whenever safely possible (not just document them here). If immediate code changes are unsafe or too broad, the agent must record a concrete deferred implementation task in `docs/qa_report_master.md`.
- Compatibility note: this instruction is written for both Codex and Claude as the orchestrator. Regardless of orchestrator, QA/review/fix-policy judgement should still be delegated to a `claude` CLI call to keep a single judgement authority.

## Operational Learnings (add/update over time)

### Preprocessing / Script Heuristic Improvements (observed in real runs)
- `ja_wrapper_misuse` false positives:
  - Current heuristic over-flags legitimate header/layout wrappers (`<p align="center"><strong>...`) that appear in all language variants (letterhead, signature, appendix title, form labels).
  - Improve by allowing known-safe zones/patterns before flagging:
    - document letterhead/header blocks near file top
    - signature block labels
    - appendix headings / form template placeholders
  - Prefer flagging only wrappers around normal body paragraphs / bullet items that are inconsistent with VI/EN counterparts.
  - Implementation expectation: update the corresponding script check logic in `scripts/` to reduce these false positives, not only the orchestrator prompt.
- JA chapter heading detection:
  - Detection must recognize both `# 第...章` and `## 第...章` (some files use H2 chapter headings).
  - Report heading-level mismatch separately from “missing chapter heading”.
  - Do not report `ja_ch=0` as content failure when chapter-like headings exist at a different level.
  - Implementation expectation: update regex and reporting categories in `scripts/` (e.g., distinguish detector miss vs heading-level mismatch).
- Disclaimer detection:
  - Script should detect standardized `[DISCLAIMER]` plus localized labels (e.g., `[免責事項]` and Vietnamese localized disclaimer labels) to avoid false negatives.
  - If project policy prefers one canonical label, enforce normalization as a separate autofix rule rather than marking as missing.
  - Implementation expectation: keep detection and normalization rules separated in `scripts/` so checks do not misreport localized labels as missing.
- Escaped pipe corruption detection/fix:
  - `\\|` in translated table rows is a common corruption pattern (especially EN/JA).
  - Safe autofix exists when scoped to table-like lines only (lines containing 2+ pipe delimiters / separator patterns).
  - Avoid global `\\| -> |` replacement in prose/code contexts.
  - Implementation expectation: implement table-line-scoped unescape autofix in `scripts/` with safety checks/logging.
- `bad_h3_article` normalization:
  - Mechanical `### Article` / `### 第...条` -> `## ...` fixes are often safe.
  - However, residual cases may be inline corruption (`...this\n### Article.`) caused by accidental line breaks; detect and fix separately.
  - Add an explicit inline-corruption check for `\n### Article.` following non-heading prose.
  - Implementation expectation: add both checks to `scripts/` (heading-level normalization candidate + inline-corruption detector/autofix).

### Claude Output Handling Robustness
- Claude may prepend explanatory text before JSON (even when asked for JSON-only).
- Orchestrator should robustly extract JSON (including fenced ```json blocks) before parsing, instead of assuming raw JSON at byte 0.
- When using Claude for exact edits, prefer structured outputs saved under `tmp/run_<run_id>/...` and parse defensively.

### Safe Fix Playbook (high-confidence patterns)
- Missing YAML required fields (`id`, `language`, `original_language`, `source_pdf`) can be autofilled from filename/path conventions after verifying source PDF existence.
- Missing EOF `SOURCE_NOTE` can be autofixed with verified source path and page count.
- Escaped pipe corruption in table-heavy EN/JA files can be autofixed with table-line-scoped unescape.
- Disclaimer insertion can be autofixed after YAML front matter, but script detection should align with accepted disclaimer labels.

### Review Policy Clarifications
- If a heuristic flag is shown to be an intentional 3-language-common formatting pattern (e.g., header `<p align="center">` wrappers), record it as `false positive / intentional formatting` and do not keep re-raising it as unresolved.
- For structural parity checks, separate:
  - content-missing (real defect)
  - heading-level mismatch (format inconsistency)
  - detector blind spot (script issue)

## Claude Orchestrator Tips (Reduce Approval Interruptions)
- When Claude is the orchestrator, prefer using a task agent / sub-agent (if available in the environment) to execute each batch end-to-end, while the parent agent handles only orchestration and monitoring.
- If task agents are not available, emulate the same pattern by generating non-interactive command sequences/scripts and executing them with file-based handoff (`tmp/run_<run_id>/...`) for prompts/results.
- Front-load all preflight checks (Claude auth, tools, target root existence, deployment workflow detection) before selecting targets, so the run fails fast instead of stopping mid-batch.
- Prefer non-interactive commands and flags; avoid any command that opens editors, pagers, or interactive wizards.
- Keep Claude judgement calls isolated and structured (JSON output + timeout wrapper), and keep execution/edit steps separate to avoid conversational pauses.
- Persist resumable state (prompts, outputs, chunk files, partial reports) under `tmp/run_<run_id>/` so auth/tool interruptions can resume without restarting.
- In confidential mode, explicitly disable any GitHub push path up front and run only repo-defined Firebase workflows to avoid accidental approval-triggering network actions.
- If the environment supports task-agent creation, pass the full batch config (`TARGET_ROOT`, `MODE`, batch size/count, timeout policy, run_id) into the task agent at launch so it can proceed without additional approvals/prompts.

### Task Agent Write-Permission Fallback (Important)
- Do NOT assume task agents can write files, even if the parent agent can.
- Before using task agents for generation/edits, run a task-agent write-capability preflight:
  - ask a task agent to create/update a small file under `tmp/run_<run_id>/task_agent_write_test/`
  - if it fails due to write permission/approval, mark `TASK_AGENT_WRITE=false` for the batch
- If `TASK_AGENT_WRITE=false`, switch to **single-writer pattern**:
  - Task agents: read-only analysis only (inventory analysis, extraction summaries, Claude QA JSON generation, fix plans, exact_edits proposals)
  - Parent orchestrator: all file writes, patch application, report updates, commits, deploy actions
- Prefer task agents for chunked QA analysis and inventory building, not direct file writes, unless write-capability preflight explicitly passes.
- Avoid background task agents for write operations. If task agents are used at all, keep write-capable operations in the parent orchestrator to reduce approval interruptions and hidden stalls.
- When task agents return draft content or `exact_edits`, require file-based structured outputs under `tmp/run_<run_id>/...` and apply them from the parent orchestrator.
